# Task-manager

This program is a program that is a task manager. 
You can either create a new file to save to or write from an existing file. 
It is simple to use so it doesn't asbtract from the simplicity of doing tasks.

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* I used interactive AI chats to learn the syntax. Going from how to construct an if statement to more complicated things like file writing and saving. 
* Used a couple videos to learn about why I should use rust and the benefits of it over other languages linked below 

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add more fields to the struct like dates and urgency level. 
* [ ] Do some more UI style changes that make it more User freindly.
* [ ] Add a delete task button or make a seperate storage / display for tasks that are done.
